# Moodle Documentation
This documentation is for the bitnami application(moodle) which is running on AWS ec2 instance

## Find Application Credentials 
### Option 1: Find Credentials By Checking The System Log On The AWS Cloud Console (EC2)
    After creating EC2 Moodle instance we will get our username and password 
    of Moodle in "Action > Instance Setting > Get System Log".

(NOTE: We can see this log only once when we stop an instance we won't see it again)

### Option 2: Find Credentials By Connecting To Your Application Through SSH
    Connect to the application through SSH.
    Run the following command to see your application credentials:
`   sudo cat /home/bitnami/bitnami_credentials
`
   
   You can find more information from 'https://docs.bitnami.com/aws/faq/get-started/find-credentials/'.

- An administrator can change theme settings and customize in "Site administration > Appearance > Themes"
    If we want to add a new theme then we can download the theme plugin from here 'https://moodle.org/plugins/'.
